# NeetCode
This repository is where I will store my neetcode practice done in python. I have decided to do this in python for two reasons. First of all, I simply want to learn python.
Second of all, python has the simplest syntax so it should make it so I can focus on the data structures and algorithms instead of complicated syntax.
